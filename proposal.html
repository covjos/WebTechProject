    <h2>Joey Coviello Project Proposal</h2>
    <p>
      My website is going to be a news and stats website about the Cleveland
      Cavaliers. The objective of my website is to give fans of the Cleveland
      Cavaliers up-to-date news about the team as well as up-to-date stats, game
      scores, and game information. My target audience are fans of the Cleveland
      Cavaliers and maybe just fans of basketball in general. I will have a home
      page of my website that will be a very eye-catching page that will draw
      people into my website. I will also have appropraie links on this page
      linking to other pages throughout the website. The sitemap page will also
      have links to appropriate pages throughout the website. The contact page
      will have my information and the Cleveland Cavaliers information. The
      other four webpages will be one about stats of individual players, one
      about the game schedule, one about game scores, one about the roster of
      the team, and one about current news for the team.
