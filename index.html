      Hi! My name is Joey Coviello. I am currently a Junior at Babson College
      studying business. <img src="Images/Joey Coviello.png" alt="" />I am from
      Cleveland, Ohio. I love sports, video games, and movies. I also have two
      sisters and a dog.
    </p>

    <p title="I'm Joey Coviello">
      I chose <a href="https://www.babson.edu/">Babson College</a> because my
      dad owns his own business selling cleaning products for motorcycles. I
      have always helped him with his business through actually making the
      products, and through marketing on social media as well as attending trade
      shows to market to current and new, potential customers. Seeing that
      Babson was #1 in entrepeneruship I really wanted to attend Babson due to
      the fact that my dad is an entrepeneur, and I have been helping him with
      his business and have enjoyed it throughout the years. Obvioulsy, when I
      graduate I would like to be an entrepeneur and start my own business.

      My favorite hobby is probably playing <strong>video games</strong> and
      <strong>waching movies</strong> as well as watching sports. In terms of
      video games, I started playing mainly

        >NBA 2K</a
      >
      when I was younger but now I mainly play any type of story mode games and
      occasionally some multiplayer stuff like COD and Fortnite. In terms of
      movies, I watch a lot of them. My favorite genres are probably horror,
      thriller, and action/adventure. When it comes to sports, I like wacthing
      all kinds of sports but mainly basketball and football. I used to play
      basketball for my high school and my middle school, and I enjoyed playing
      it a lot. I also played football for one year but did not like it too
      much.
